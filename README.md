 8. CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS

API Rate Limiting: The free tier of The Spoonacular API has limitations. Implemented client-side caching to reduce API calls.

Security: Avoided hardcoding API keys by using environment variables:
```bash
docker run -d -e API_KEY=your_key --name app -p 8080:8080 innocent2/recipe-generator:v1
```
